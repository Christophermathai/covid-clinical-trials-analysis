# COVID Clinical Trials Analysis

This repository, **covid-clinical-trials-analysis**, contains tools and resources for analyzing clinical trials related to COVID-19. The goal of this project is to facilitate the exploration, visualization, and statistical analysis of clinical trial data to derive insights about COVID-19 treatments, interventions, and study outcomes.

## Features

- **Data Ingestion**: Scripts for downloading and cleaning clinical trial datasets (e.g., from ClinicalTrials.gov).
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Notebooks and scripts for summary statistics, visualizations, and descriptive analytics.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Methods for hypothesis testing, regression analysis, and comparison of trial outcomes.
- **Visualization**: Tools for plotting trends, timelines, and geographical distributions of clinical trials.
- **Reporting**: Generation of reports to summarize key findings and results.
